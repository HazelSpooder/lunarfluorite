Battle against the Doctor's favorite assistant from the movies in Sonic 3 A.I.R!

This mod replaces most of the minibosses from Sonic 3 & Knuckles with Agent Stone piloting his own versions of the minibosses. This is the demo version, which has him piloting the Sonic 3 half of the minibosses.

Features:

	-Unique sprites and animations for each boss!
	-AI tweaks for the HCZ, CNZ, and ICZ minibosses when playing as Knuckles, as they did not have any in the original game!
	-Various changes and additions to improve upon the fights or make them more lively, some of which come from Sonic Origins!
	-Stone replacing Egg Robo in Knuckles's route!
	-A custom, coded from scratch miniboss, exclusive to Knuckles! A first for Sonic 3 A.I.R!
	-3 different palettes to choose from, with more coming in the future!
	-3 different types of boss themes to choose from:
	-Both boss themes from the Genesis version of Sonic 3D Blast, either one playing depending on what boss you fight
	-A Sonic 3 styled remix of the Saturn Sonic 3D Blast boss theme
	-A remixed version of the miniboss theme from Sonic Hoshi
	-Compatibility with various other mods! (Check the readme for the full list!)
There is plenty more to come in the future, but for now, we hope you enjoy fighting against Agent Stone in Sonic 3 A.I.R.!
